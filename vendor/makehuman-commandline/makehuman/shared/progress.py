Abstract
--------

The Progress module defines the Progress class, which provides
an easy interface for handling MH's progress bar.
It automatically processes porgress updates in subroutines, so
passing progress callbacks as function parameters is needless.

*-- Usage --*

from progress import Progress


# Standard usage.

def foo():
    progress = Progress()

    ... # do stuff #
    progress(0.7)
    ... # more stuff #
    progress(1.0)


# Usage in steps.

def bar():
    progress = Progress(42)

    ... # step 1 #
    progress.step()
    ... # step 2 #
    progress.step()
    ....
    ....
    ... # step 42 #
    progress.step()


# Usage in loops.

def baz(items):
    progress = Progress(len(items))

    for item in items:
        loopprog = Progress()
        ... # do stuff #
        loopprog(0.3)
        ... # more stuff #
        loopprog(0.6)
        ... # even more stuff #
        progress.step()


# All together!!!

def FooBarBaz():
    progress = Progress.begin()

    progress(0, 0.3, "Getting some foo")
    somefoo = foo()

    progress(0.3, 0.7, None)
    prog2 = Progress() (0, 0.5, "Getting a bar")
    bar1 = bar()
    prog2(0.5, 1, "Getting another bar")
    bar2 = bar()

    progress(0.7, 0.99, "Bazzing them all together")
    bazzable = [somefoo, bar1, bar2]
    baz(bazzable)

    progress(1.0, None, "Foobar bazzed.")


-----

- Weighted steps

Progress constructor can accept an iterable as the steps parameter.
In that case, the weighted step mode is activated, and steps with
greater weight in the iterable affect larger area of the progress bar.

Example:
progress = Progress([7, 3, 6, 6])

- Logging

With the logging=True option, Progress will log.debug its progress and
description for every change in its progress. (This does not include
sub-Progresses that have logging disabled.) A number of dashes is added
at the beginning of the log message representing the level of nesting
of the current procedure, to help distinguish between the messages logged
from the parent and the child Progress. With logging=False, this feature
is forced disabled. The default setting, logging=None, inherits the logging
setting from its parent (resolves to False if root progress has no logging 
enabled).

If messaging is enabled too, on a description change, Progress will log.debug
only its progress, and will let messaging to log.message the description
afterwards.

- Timing

If logging is enabled, with the timing=True option, Progress will measure
and log.debug the time each step took to complete, as well as the total time
needed for the whole procedure.

- Messaging

With the messaging=True option, Progress will log.message its description
every time it changes.

Abstract
--------

Tools and interfaces for managing caches.

A cache is a container associated with a method.
When the method is called, the result is stored in the
cache, and on subsequent calls of the method the stored
result is returned, so that no recomputation is needed.
The result of the method will be recalculated once the
cache is explicitly invalidated (emptied) and the method
gets called again.

To use the caching mechanisms in your code, simply use
the Cache decorator in front of the method you want to cache.

Example:

@Cache
def method(self):
    ...

To invalidate a cached result, you can assign Cache Empty to
your method's cache: self.method.cache = Cache.Empty

You can also use Cache.invalidate to inalidate caches,
like so: Cache.invalidate(self, "method1", "method2")

Or use Cache.invalidateAll to clear all caches of an object:
Cache.invalidateAll(self)

If your object happens to have a method that somehow processes
all of its caches, and returns a similar object with the same
methods but with all the computation done, decorate it as
Cache.Compiler. When next time a method is called, the computed
object's methods will be called instead of returning the method's
cache, if the object is newer than the cache.

        """
        A Cache Compiler is a special form of cache,
        which when invoked creates a "Compiled Cache".

        A Compiled Cache is a cache that is stored in the
        parent's Cache Manager, and essentialy replaces
        the parent. So, the method that will be decorated
        with the Compiler has to return an object with the
        same type as the parent, or at least one that supports
        the same methods of the parent that are decorated as
        Cache. After that, whenever a cached method is called,
        the result is taken from the compiled cache (except if
        the method's cache is newer).

        This is useful for objects that cache many parameters,
        but also have a greater method that creates a 'baked'
        replica of themselves. After the 'baking', the parameters
        can simply be taken from the cached replica.

class SelectionColorMap:

    """
    The objects support the use of a technique called *Selection Using Unique
    Color IDs*, that internally uses color-coding of components within the
    scene to support the selection of objects by the user using the mouse.

    This technique generates a sequence of colors (color IDs), assigning a
    unique color to each uniquely selectable object or component in the scene.
    These colors are not displayed, but are used by MakeHuman to generates an
    unseen image of the various selectable elements. This image uses the same
    camera settings currently being used for the actual, on-screen image.
    When the mouse is clicked, the position of the mouse is used with the
    unseen image to retrieve a color. MakeHuman uses this color as an ID to
    identify which object or component the user clicked with the mouse.

    This technique uses glReadPixels() to read the single pixel at the
    current mouse location, using the unseen, color-coded image.

    For further information on this technique, see:

      - http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/selection.htm and
      - http://wiki.gamedev.net/index.php/OpenGL_Selection_Using_Unique_Color_IDs

    **Note.** Because the 3D engine uses glDrawElements in a highly opimized
    way and each vertex can have only one color ID, there there is a known
    problem with selecting individual faces with very small FaceGroups using
    this technique. However, this is not a major problem for MakeHuman, which
    doesn't use such low polygon groupings.
    
    - **self.colorIDToFaceGroup**: *Dictionary of colors IDs* A dictionary of the color IDs used for
      selection (see MakeHuman Selectors, above).
    - **self.colorID**: *float list* A progressive color ID.
    
    The attributes *self.colorID* and *self.colorIDToFaceGroup*
    support a technique called *Selection Using Unique Color IDs* to make each
    FaceGroup independently clickable.

    The attribute *self.colorID* stores a progressive color that is incremented for each successive
    FaceGroup added to the scene.
    The *self.colorIDToFaceGroup* attribute contains a list that serves as a directory to map
    each color back to the corresponding FaceGroup by using its color ID.

        image map to determine the FaceGroup that a mouse click was made in.

        This method loops through the FaceGroups, assigning the next color
        in the sequence to each subsequent FaceGroup. The color value is
        written into a 'dictionary' to serve as a color ID that can be
        translated back into the corresponding FaceGroup name when a mouse
        click is detected.

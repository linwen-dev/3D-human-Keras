Abstract

This module defines the File class, an object that represents a file that
is being edited inside MakeHuman.

        aditional information about the cause of the event, with a usage
        similar to using flags - i.e. like: if "save" in event.reasons: (...).

        The data member is an optional extra object for the event to carry.

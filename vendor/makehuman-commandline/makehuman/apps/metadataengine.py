Abstract
--------

This module implements a simple set of algorithms to handle MakeHuman 
metadata tags within large files. This is used to search for, load and 
save records in text files that are used to index library files. 
Each record in the text file contains a recordID that is the full file 
system path to a MakeHuman library file and a sequence of keywords 
attributed to that library file.  

This module has been tested with 30000 objects with 400000 tags, on an old PC,
with the following results:

- Load record using recordID, worst case:  0.00368905067444 sec
- Search records using tags, worst case:  0.0546329021454 sec
- Save/update records: 0.210602998734 sec

Because of these performance figures and because of MakeHuman file management requirements 
(single user, local files, basic usage, etc.), we have decided to use this baby-proof module 
to add new dependencies instead of using an ultra powerful external database that would be
of limited value in the context required for MakeHuman.

If the following content is contained in a plain text file called \"tags.txt\"...

::

    c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj1.obj hand long fist clenched
    c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj2.obj leg calf muscular
    c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj3.obj nose broad hooked
    c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj4.obj eye brown 
    c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj5.obj eyelash thick long
    c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj6.obj lips lush
    c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj7.obj sheyenne indian aboriginal
    ...

the following examples illustrate the use of the load search and save functions:

::

    r1 = loadRecord('tags.txt', 'c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj2.obj')
    // Sets r1 to be the list [\"c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj2.obj\",\"leg\",\"calf\",\"muscular\"]

    r2 = searchRecord('tags.txt', 'eye')
    // Sets r2 to be the list [\"c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj4.obj\",\"c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj5.obj\",\"c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj7.obj\"]

    recordToSave = 'c:\MakeHuman\objectlibrary\obj5.obj eyelash thick long black'
    saveRecord('tags.txt', recordToSave)
    // Replaces the existing 'obj5' record with the new record in the file on disk.

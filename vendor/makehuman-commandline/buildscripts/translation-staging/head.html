    <h1>Translations</h1>
    <p>These are languages that have been imported from transifex, and which are either
    accepted or under review. In the table you will find the following columns:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Raw:</b> This is a HTML dump of original strings + translated strings. 
      This is what you should look at if you know the language in question.</li>
      <li><b>Google translate:</b> This is a link which picks the raw file and translates
      all the non-english strings back to english. The result is lines with english original
      and english back-translated. Use this for a language you don't know in order to see
      if there is something which is obviously wrong. Note that for several languages the
      google translate algorithms are somewhat erratic, so it is not to be expected that
      the lines are <i>exactly</i> the same. Even if the translation seem odd, this too might
      be due to google translate. However this link can be used to pick up obviously wrong
      translations.</li>
      <li><b>Transifex:</b> This links back to the source material at transifex. Here you 
      can create an account and review language files and suggest changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further you can <a href="lang.zip">download a zip with language files</a> which are suitable for use in MakeHuman. Find the directory "data/languages" in your installation directory and unzip this file there. Next time you start MakeHuman you will be able to choose between the languages under settings.</p>

Description: Free, open source tool for creating realistic 3D human characters.
 MakeHuman is a free, open source software which allows the creation of 
 realistic 3D human characters fast and in a simplified manner, through the 
 manipulation of controls for different human attributes.
 .
 Users are able to model human characters by manipulating the controls to modify 
 various human characteristics such as gender, age, height, weight and ethnicity 
 as well as low level details of things such as the eye's shape, mouth's shape 
 or finger's length. Via a 'point and click' approach, users can preview and 
 load poses, animation cycles, facial expressions, hair, shoes and clothes onto 
 characters from the MakeHuman™ Library. The human characters created can be 
 saved in the custom MakeHuman format (.mhm), rendered and exported in various 
 formats such as Collada (.dae), Filbox (.fbx), MD5, Blender exchange (.mhx), 
 Wavefront .obj, Stereolithography (.stl).
 .
 The output characters are licensed under the CC0 license, one of the most 
 liberal license for output content. This means that artists are given the 
 freedom to use their creations for both commercial and non-commercial 
 purposes. The copyright © 2001-2013 is retained by the MakeHuman™ Team
